# Mudi

## Development
* Java (1.8) was used for the structuring with Spring Boot.
* Data is processed with Spring Data and stored in a MariaDB database.
* Spring MVC was responsible for the Web part.
* Styling was done with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.
* The login and security system was done with Spring Security.

## Project
* The project is a store for controlling orders, which are registered and structured with status.
* These orders have the idea that we have two types of users in the application: The first is the user who will generate offers for the orders that are made and the other user is the one who will register the orders.
